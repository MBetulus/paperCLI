# paperCLI
refunctioning an electronic typewriter as live CLI output and beyond. Target is a live feedreader.

We're working with an old electronic Typewriter of the German brand "privileg" - It's got a cpu, ROMs and RAM. Specs will follow! We thought It'd be a fun project to connect an arduino to the Keyboard input and use the printer as a live feedreader of e.g. a Telegram Group (With input as well), Twitter or some other news source!

Project on hold until June/July (The 'Rona).
